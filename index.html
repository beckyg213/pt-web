 <em>Performance & song  : musicals and what you’re missing out on . </em>
 
<div id="container">
  <div id="content">Many of us know what musicals are. Some us have grown up knowing of things such high school musical or frozen. But that isn’t what this is about. Theatre productions have been around for longer then we can remember. From Greek with their musical celebrations of the gods to the performances we see now such grease or Wizard of Oz. But I’m here to talk about some of my favourite musicals. </div>
  <div id="navbar"> 1 . Blood brothers .  Written by Willy Russell ‘ blood brothers’ revolves around Mickey and Eddie twin brothers who were separated at  birth. One being raised by a wealthy family and one being raised by a poor one. Within this musical we delve into the ever growing stories of these two separated brothers from being children when the two of them meet accidently all through how they grow into adulthood not knowing that the two of them were brothers until it was too late. Blood brothers is a musical that takes you through a world of emotions. From the happy upbeat songs of childhood to the sorrowful result of adulthood it is a musical that will make you laugh and cry and all the right times and thus is one of my favourite musicals to watch in the theatre. </div>

    <h1><em>Heading 1 </em></h1>    
  Music is a universal concept we are all aware on. For so many years music has been something we have always been aware of. We grow up listening to music and developing our own tastes. Music is there for us when we are happy or when we are sad. Now days’ there are so many aspiring artists releasing music. So many people pouring their hearts and souls into songs that they want to do well. However with such a large music market we as people do not have enough time to be aware of new artists. So there are times where it’s easy to miss out on amazing tracks. However this is where I can hopefully introduce you to some of the ones that you might be missing.
