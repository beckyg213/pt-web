              <div id="content">2. <b>Phantom Of The Opera.</b> Written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, it is based on the French novel by Gaston Leroux, it’s based in the 19th century where a brooding phantom takes an interest in the vocalist in the opera house called Christine Daae. The musical is so beautifully represented with it’s classic sounds and operatic voices. It’s so easy to fall in love with the songs that are performed and is such an amazing musical to look out for. Phantom of the opera is a classic musical that any person can find enjoyment in. <p>
                  3. <b>Fame.</b> Many of us know part of the song ‘ fame! I wanna live forever ‘ with it’s catchy beat. Fame the musical is based off the 1980’s musical film of the same name. The musical is based around New York City's High School of Performing Arts and the hopefully young individuals that are auditioning work for a place there in hopes of archiving their creative dreams. Within this we delve into the individual stories of each successful youth and how they put their differences aside and overcome boundaries within their selves and together as a team. The songs that are introduced feel this portray these issues to an audience, with many that we as people can relate to. Overall, it is a feel good musical with a enlightening element to it. </p>
              </div>
              <div id="navbar"> Many of us know what musicals are. Some us have grown up knowing of things such high school musical or frozen. But that isn’t what this is about. Theatre productions have been around for longer then we can remember. From Greek with their musical celebrations of the gods to the performances we see now such grease or Wizard of Oz. But I’m here to talk about some of my favourite musicals.<p>
                  1 .<b> Blood brothers . </b>Written by Willy Russell ‘ blood brothers’ revolves around Mickey and Eddie. Twin brothers who were separated at birth. One being raised by a wealthy family and one being raised by a poor one. Within this musical we delve into the ever-growing stories of these two separated brothers from being children when the two of them meet accidently all through how they grow into adulthood not knowing that the two of them were brothers until it was too late. Blood brothers is a musical that takes you through a world of emotions. From the happy upbeat songs of childhood to the sorrowful result of adulthood it is a musical that will make you laugh and cry and all the right times and thus is one of my favourite musicals to watch in the theatre. <p>
